# HMI Project

## Project - Overlapping Perspectives
This training is done in collaboration with the English teacher.
The objective is both to stimulate discussion and to experiment with peer review through a "call for papers" to which the students must answer.

This course will divide as follows:
* **First two classes**: 	
  * acquisition of data, design of proposal,
  *  fill out evaluation form
	* pass on  proposal and evaluation form to the other 7.45 or 10.00 o'clock group.
	* start  PPt
			
All  work (except the Ptt) will be anonymized

* **Off the class**:
  * study the various proposals received 
	* fill out a Google form and write report.

* **Class 3**:
  *	Peer review process: Use the Google form plus other notes to present and debate in the class your view on your analysis to suggest lines of 			improvements for each of the proposals.
			
* **Class 4**:
  * Presentation of your PPt that will be ended by your video teaser that will integrate the critics and advice sent by the peer reviewers.
